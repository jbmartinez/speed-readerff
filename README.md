# Speed-reader for Firefox
This is a speed reading extension for Firefox based on [OpenSpritz](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz)
which is in turn ispired by [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/).

Right now is almost a 1:1 OpenSpritz bookmarklet installed on the browser,
slightly modified to turn it in a browser extension. Nevertheless, it seems
to work very well in my tests. Some improvements might come on the future.

Control icons are part of [IcoMoon - Free icon set](http://icomoon.io/#icons), designed by Keyamoon.

## Installation
Download the Firefox [Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation)
and build the extension with the command `cfx xpi`, then load the resulting
xpi file onto Firefox.

You also can simply download the speed-readerff.xpi file from this repository.

## Known Bugs
* Icon is awful.
